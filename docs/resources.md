### Bayesian Network (Structure learning of bayesian network)

#### Bayesian Network Guidelines
In general, research about BN consists 2 parts. One is that the structure of the bayesian network is known, and they do the inference. The other is that the structure of the network is unknown and we must learn it from the data. To our project, it may be the 2nd case. So we can keep in mind to focus on “bayesian network structure learning” when we do the research.

#### General BN Tutorials

 - [This](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmarg/Papers/PhD-Thesis-Margaritis.pdf) contains a lot of details on structure learning.
 - [This](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fronandaly.org%2Fpublications%2Fdaly11learnBayesNet%2Fdaly11learnBayesNet.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF-1r8vYsm437ueYsV5Mmvqb3Dw8w) is a survey on the things to pay attention when doing BN learning.

If you prefer watching videos to reading papers, [this](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fvideolectures.net%2Fmlss09uk_bishop_ibi%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEtpxiYOGLJVcUhyo4RDtOKq33K7g) is a tutorial on Bayesian learning, and [this](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fvideolectures.net%2Fmlss09uk_ghahramani_gm%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHK9stxmaisqIHQmtM430zbMfXYJg) is a tutorial for graphical model (which is a generalization of BN)

Particular for our project, we want to learn the things related to __bayesian network structure learning__, which is to infer the structure of that network.
